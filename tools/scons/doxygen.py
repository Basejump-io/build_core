# This doxygen builder does not parse the input file and populate the file list
# using an emmitter for this reason to use this builder it is best to specify
# env.Doxygen(source='<doxygen_config_file>', target=Dir('tmp')) 
#    Where the tmp directory is never created meaning that doxygen is run every
#    time the SCons is run
# env.Clean('Doxygen_html', Dir('html'))
#    Where 'html' is the output directory if building latex the output directory 
#    would be latex
